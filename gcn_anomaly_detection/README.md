# GCN Anomaly Detection

A Python package for anomaly detection using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). This package provides tools for loading data, converting it into graph format, training a GCN model, and evaluating its performance.

## Features
- **Data Loading**: Load datasets and convert them into graph data using k-nearest neighbors.
- **GCN Model**: A simple 2-layer Graph Convolutional Network for anomaly detection.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Train the GCN model and evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization**: Plot confusion matrices to visualize model performance.

## Installation

### Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gcn_anomaly_detection.git
cd gcn_anomaly_detection
